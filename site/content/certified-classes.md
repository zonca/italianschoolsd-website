## Accredited classes

Italian school of San Diego LLC is accredited both with the San Diego Unified and the San Dieguito Union High School Districts as an "Independent World Language School".
Therefore classes taken at the Italian school will give credit for the language requirement for High School graduation, and will also satisfy the admission requirements for colleges.

### How many years

High school graduation and college admission requires 2 years of a foreign language, but most colleges recommend 3 years, and some Ivy league colleges, like Harvard, recommend 4. See for example the [E) requirement for admission to University of California](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html), quoted here for reference:

> Two years, or equivalent to the 2nd level of high school instruction, of the same language other than English are required. (Three years/3rd level of high school instruction recommended). Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, composition and culture. [..]. Courses taken in the seventh and eighth grades may be used to fulfill part or all of this requirement if the high school accepts them as equivalent to its own courses.

### Location

All classes will be held via Zoom, with occasional optional social gatherings in person.

### Calendar

* 35 weekly classes, 2 hours each, and 2 hours of independent studies
* Classes start on the week of September 5th and end in mid-June
* The schedule will be decided by each class based on the students' preference
