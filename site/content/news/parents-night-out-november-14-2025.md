🧁 **Autumn Snack Ideas**

Expect cozy, nut-free treats such as mini pumpkin muffins, apple slices with cinnamon dip, and warm cider to keep everyone energized for the evening.

🎨 **Activities**

1. **Painted Glass Lanterns** - Children paint and decorate glass jars using acrylics or translucent colors, add LED tea lights, and create glowing lanterns to take home.
2. **Leaf Bowl - Ciotola-foglia in Argilla** - Each child creates a clay bowl pressed with a real leaf, then paints and seals it after drying.

🎲 **Games**

**Calm Games**

1. **Musical Statues / Statue Musicali** - Kids dance to bilingual cues; when the music stops, everyone freezes. Bilingual cue: "Freeze! / Fermi!"
2. **Blindfold Autumn / Mosca Cieca Autunnale** - One child is blindfolded; others say "foglia" or "leaf" and the blindfolded player guesses who spoke.

**Active Game**

3. **Flying Leaf / Foglia Volante** - Each child gets a paper leaf; on "vento!" they blow it across the floor without using hands. Fast, contact-free fun.

📸 **Photo Corner - "Autumn Lights Corner"**

Set up at pick-up time so families can snap a photo memory under our lantern backdrop.
