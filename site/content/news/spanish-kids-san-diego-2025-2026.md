The Italian School of San Diego is excited to announce that we are continuing our children's program with Spanish classes for the 2025-2026 academic year!

Our classes are taught by a native Spanish teacher and are held in-person at our school in Kearny Mesa.

No previous knowledge of Spanish is required for the beginner class. We offer two levels: a beginner class for students new to Spanish, and an intermediate class for students who have already completed at least one year of Spanish. Both levels are held at the same time and location, with engaging activities tailored to each group.

## Schedule

Wednesdays 2:30pmâ€“4:00pm. First class: September 3rd, last class: May 20th, for a total of 33 weeks of instruction

## Location

* All kids' classes are held at our main 1500 sqft location: 4550 Kearny Villa Rd Suite 202. See our [dedicated page about our school](/location).

## Tuition

Tuition for 9 months of instruction for early enrollment (payment **before August 7th**) is:

**$1242**

Students also enrolled in our Italian program receive a 10% discount:

## Material Fee

There is an additional $150 material fee for all kids joining in-person classes. This covers office and craft supplies purchased throughout the year.
