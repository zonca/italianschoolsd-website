The Italian School of San Diego is excited to announce the continuation of our children's Spanish program for the 2025–2026 academic year!

Classes are taught in person at our Kearny Mesa campus by a native Spanish-speaking teacher.

No prior Spanish experience is required for the beginner class. We offer two levels: a beginner class for students new to Spanish, and an intermediate class for those who have completed at least one year of Spanish. Both levels meet at the same time and location, with engaging activities tailored to each group.

## Schedule

Wednesdays, 2:30–4:00pm. First class: September 3rd. Last class: May 20th. The program includes 33 weeks of instruction.

## Location

* All kids' classes are held at our main 1,500 sq ft location: 4550 Kearny Villa Rd, Suite 202. See our [dedicated page about our school](/location).

## Tuition

Tuition for 9 months of instruction (early enrollment, payment **before August 7th**):

**$1,242**

Students also enrolled in our Italian program receive a 10% discount:

## Materials Fee

There is an additional $150 materials fee for all students joining in-person classes. This covers office and craft supplies for the year.
