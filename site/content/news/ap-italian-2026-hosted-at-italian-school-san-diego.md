Italian School of San Diego has a long partnership with San Diego Unified, as we offer accredited Italian classes from Italian 1–2 through 7–8 (AP preparation).

What “accredited” means: Grades earned in our classes are added to the student’s high school transcript and satisfy both high school graduation and college admission world‑language requirements. Students may take Italian instead of Spanish, or take both.

Programs at a glance:

- Italian 1–2 (beginners): Start from zero and build a solid foundation in speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
- Italian 3–4: Continue developing grammar and vocabulary with more conversation and composition.
- Italian 5–6: Upper‑intermediate work to reach strong proficiency and readiness for advanced study.
- Italian 7–8 & AP Preparation: Advanced topics plus targeted AP practice and exam strategies.
- For Italian speakers: Dedicated tracks (ita1–2, ita3–4, ita5–6, ita7–8 & AP Prep).
