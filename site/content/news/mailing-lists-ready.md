After having issues with Google Groups emails going into spam,
we created email lists directly on our domain `italianschoolsd.com`,
in the form `classname@italianschoolsd.com`.

We have 1 mailing list per class which includes the Maestra (teacher) and
all the email addresses provided during pre-enrollment.

If you would like to unsubscribe your email address, the easiest way is
to send an email to `classname-leave@italianschoolsd.com`, where `classname` is
the name of the list (I won't list them here to avoid spam).

### Hotmail.com and Outlook.com users

I noticed that Hotmail.com/Outlook.com tends to categorize emails from these lists as spam, please check the Spam folder, go to the advanced menu of that email and click on "Add to safe senders" and confirm. That will make sure that future emails won't go to spam.
