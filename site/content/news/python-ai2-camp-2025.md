The Italian School of San Diego is proud to host the Python + AI2 Summer Coding Camp in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, from July 28 to August 1, 2025. This hands-on camp empowers Middle and High School students of all backgrounds to explore Python programming and artificial intelligence—no prior experience required. Participants will build a text-based game in Python and enhance it with AI features, all within a browser-based environment. Both morning and afternoon sessions are available. The camp fee is $360 and instruction is led by Dr. Andrea Zonca (UCSD).
