We are launching a new **Online Italian class for 3rd–6th grade students** who cannot easily travel to our San Diego location (distance, traffic, schedule, or living outside the area).

**Schedule:** Wednesdays **4:00–5:30pm (Pacific Time)** via **Zoom**. 

**Program dates:** Starts the **first week of October 2025** (planned first class: **October 1st, 2025**) and ends at the **end of May 2026** (last class planned: **May 27th, 2026**), for a total of **30 classes** (45 hours of instruction) accounting for holiday breaks.


All of our instructors are **native Italian teachers** with experience teaching elementary-age learners.

**No previous Italian experience is required.** The class starts from the basics and builds gradually. We focus on speaking and listening first while introducing only the **essential grammar** (articles, gender/number agreement, present tense verbs, simple sentence structure) to give students a solid framework without overwhelming them.

### Who is this for?

This class is ideal for:

* Students (3rd–6th grade) who live outside San Diego or prefer learning from home
* Families looking for high-quality Italian instruction without the commute
* Students who want structured, progressive Italian language learning in a small-group setting.

The course blends interactive conversation, games, vocabulary building, and cultural elements. Homework will be light (10–15 minutes between classes) to reinforce retention.
