---

In Italy, when you say "Il Festival", it only means "Festival di Sanremo", the most popular song contest in Italy. On the other hand, a lot of Italians have never heard of Eurovision.

It is a great opportunity to expose the kids to the Italian language and culture: whether you like it or not, Sanremo is iconic!

The show streams on RAI 1 from February 7th to February 11th from 12pm to 4:30pm Pacific Standard Time at:

Moreover, RAI posts additional content, like recordings of previous nights, at:

* [Page about the Festival of Sanremo on Raiplay](https://www.rai.it/programmi/sanremo/)



If you would like to quickly add all the events to your calendar, you can checkout the [Italian school of San Diego Calendar](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/calendar/).

Just for Sanremo the Italian television removes geographical restrictions, so you **do not need** a VPN.

You can watch it on a TV by installing the "Raiplay" app, opening a browser (for example Amazon Silk on Firestick), or by streaming it on your laptop and casting the tab to the TV.

Buon ascolto!
