Thursday was our last week of school before the winter break.  I want to take a moment to thank all of you for being part of our Italian family and helping everybody grow in this wonderful journey.

Classes for the young students will resume the second week of January according to their calendar, still at Language Door.

We are happy to announce that we are in escrow for a larger location for the school, a few blocks from Language Door, at [4550 Kearny Villa Rd](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCuxYSToh9WzUZze6). Our current plan is to move there on Thursday January 25th, but we will keep you posted.

Wishing a restful and joyful winter break to all of you I will see you
in January or our language adventure to continue.
