We are launching a new Italian online class targeted at kids that can already speak some Italian, level A2-B1.

"L'Italiano, l'Italia e il calcio" is a new program that leverages the sports culture in Italy (mostly focused on Soccer) to teach the Italian language (grammar and conversation) and to teach about Italy (geography, monuments, culture).

The first class will be on Wednesday November 8th between 4pm and 5:30pm and the last class on Wednesday May 29th for a total of 25 classes.

Tuition for the full program is $940, we also offer a monthly payment plan for an additional 20% admin fee.

Please pre-enroll by October 20th, we will then send an invoice, payment of the invoice finalizes enrollment.
