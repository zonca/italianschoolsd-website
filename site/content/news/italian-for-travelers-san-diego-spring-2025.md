Over the course of 2022 5.3 million Americans travelled to Italy, that is almost 10% of the entire population of Italy itself!

I'm sure you would like to go prepared, at least with basic phrases that can help you go outside of the beaten path where Italians rarely speak English, and some extra confidence in using Google Translate or an "Italian phrases for travelers" book!

We will be covering basic phrases at the airport, hotel, restaurant, retail store, emergency room, pharmacy, beach and all details about coffee and pizza that only Italians know. No previous knowledge of Italian necessary, however you are very welcome if you already know some Italian and want to strenghten your travel-related vocabulary.

We are excited to offer a "Italian for travelers" program, focused on the entire family, so you can bring your kids (8 years old and above) with you, please [contact us](/contact) if you would like to bring younger siblings, we can organize entertainment for them in our kids room during class
