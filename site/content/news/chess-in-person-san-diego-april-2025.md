Playing chess sharpens problem-solving skills, improves memory, fosters patience, and builds confidence. Kids develop logical thinking and creativity, while adults can continue to challenge themselves and enhance decision-making abilities. Chess also promotes good sportsmanship and social interaction for everyone involved.

Coach Navid started playing competitive chess at age 9 and is now *United States Chess Federation Expert*, and has been teaching chess in schools across San Diego county since 2021.
