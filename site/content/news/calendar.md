We just published the calendar for the Academic year 2021-2022, see [the dedicated page](/calendar).

You can automatically add it to your calendars.

For now the calendar only includes the in-person [Italian-heritage classes](/classes), we will then create separate calendars for the online and in-person Italian-learners classes.
