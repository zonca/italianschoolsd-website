Buon Anno! (Happy [New] Year!)
Due to the number of requests, we are starting a new beginner class:

* Group class
* Targeted at adults
* No previous knowledge of Italian required, of course it doesnâ€™t hurt to have it!
* In-person in Kearny Mesa
* Thursdays 6:15pm-7:45pm
* 6 classes of 1.5 hours each, first class Jan 12th, last class Feb 16th
* The class will focus on conversational skills, just the necessary grammar for support

[Please check this link for more information and to enroll!](https://www.italianschoolsd.com/enroll-adults/)

At the end of these classes, you will have the opportunity to continue in a beginner class or graduate to an intermediate level class.
