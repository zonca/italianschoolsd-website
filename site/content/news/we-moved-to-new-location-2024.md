We finalized escrow for our new location on January 9th, and we started classes there on January 22nd.

As planned, January 25th is going to be the first time we have all the 5 kids classes at the new location.

The address is:

4550 Kearny Villa Rd Suite 202

Also updated the location on Google Maps:

When you enter the parking lot, find a parking spot just after the first corner of the building, you should see building 4550 (Not 4540), we are at the second floor in suite 202, look for the Italian school logo at the window.  Notice there is 1-way circulation around the building, i.e. you cannot exit where you entered but need to go all around the buildings.

Looking forward to welcoming you to the long-term location of our school! If you have ideas about initiatives that we could organize at the school, please [contact us!](/contact)
