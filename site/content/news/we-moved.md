Unfortunately Our Mother of Confidence notified us last May that due to changing rules at the Diocese, they wouldn’t have been able to host us for 2022-2023.

We have found a new location in Kearny Mesa, just out the 805, at 7380 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. We sublease the entire language school “Language Door” on Thursdays 4-6pm.

The new location is less than 5 miles from Our Mother of Confidence, here an estimate without considering traffic of the impact on our parents' "commuting":

* For people coming from North down the 15, the new location is a bit closer, 4 miles less and 2 minutes less
* For people coming from North down the 5, time and distance are about the same
* For people coming from South up the 805, the new location is a bit closer, 4 miles less and 3 minutes less
* For people coming from South up the 5 (South of the junction with 163), the new location is a bit further, 2 minutes more
