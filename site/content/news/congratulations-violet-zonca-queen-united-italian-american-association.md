We are proud to announce that Violet Zonca, one of our talented students at the Italian School of San Diego, has been selected as the 2025/2026 Queen of the United Italian American Association.

During the annual gala, Violet represented the Italian community with grace, confidence, and cultural pride. Wearing the official sash and crown, she participated in the ceremony and photo session as the newest ambassador of Italian heritage for the coming year.

This honor highlights not only her personal dedication, but also the strong connection between our school and the Italian American community. As Queen, Violet will take part in cultural events, parades, and celebrationsâ€”promoting Italian language and traditions.

We are extremely proud of you, Violet! Your success is an inspiration to all our students! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‘‘
