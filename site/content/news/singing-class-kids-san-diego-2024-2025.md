Italian school of San Diego is excited to announce that we will be expanding our children program to also include Singing classes for the 2024-2025 academic year.

We offer a fun and engaging environment where children can explore the joy of singing while developing their musical talents. Our classes are designed for kids from 1st grade to 8th grade split in 2 classes by age, ensuring that every child receives personalized attention and guidance.

The class is targeted to beginners and requires no previous experience in music theory or singing, it will focus on:

* Breathing Techniques: Learn the foundation of singing with proper breathing methods to support and enhance your voice.
* Intonation Practice: Develop a keen sense of pitch and melody to sing in tune with confidence.
* Song Selection: Enjoy singing popular songs chosen by the kids, ensuring an exciting and personalized experience.

The class will be taught in English by Antonella Calabrese, an accomplished Italian singer, and vocal teacher, see more details below.
