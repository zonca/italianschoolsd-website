As a special event for the class just before Halloween, in the last 45 minutes of class
we played 2 rounds of [Lupus in Tabula (also known as Werewolf or Mafia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) all in Italian.

We had 14 kids from 4th, 5th an a few 6th grade special guests.

Playing board games engages kids in a fun way, in particular "Lupus in Tabula" is a hidden-role game,
where villagers need to discuss and try to deduct who are the werewolves.
Once a person is accused, they have the opportunity of giving a speech do defend themselves.

You tend to get quite creative in your talking to avoid being lynched by an angry mob!
