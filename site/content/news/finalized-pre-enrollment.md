We created all the classes, assigned teachers and delivered invoices.
Please pay the invoice by August 29th to complete enrollment.

If you pre-enrolled and haven’t received either an invoice or an email explaining why we couldn’t find a class suitable for you, something went wrong, please [contact us](/contact).

We are still working on 4 Italian-learners classes:

* Adult beginners
* Adult intermediate
* 1st/2nd grade beginners
* 3rd/4th grade beginners

We will keep you posted if you expressed interest in one of them.
Also, pre-enrollment is still open, there are several spots available in the classes already estabilished.
