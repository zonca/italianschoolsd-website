We are glad to announce Italian classes for kids from Kindergarden to 8th grade,
the classes are going to be in-person on Wednesdays at our new location:

The address is [4550 Kearny Villa Rd STE 202](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DSmbWhhoeKjhL1mo8), at the crossing of Balboa Avenue and Freeway 163, close to In-and-Out.
We are at the second floor, make sure you go to building 4550.

We will have 2 hour classes from 4pm to 6pm, with a 15 minutes break, we plan to split the kids by age in 3 or 4 groups, depending on the number of kids enrolled.

Our program will teach the kids the basics of the Italian language through fun activities, songs, crafts and drawing using visual aids and age-appropriate games.

Middle-schoolers can then enroll in our [certified program](/accredited-classes/) that satisfies High School graduation and college admission requirements.

We also have [an adult class for beginners](/adults) at the same time and same location, so that parents can take a separate Italian class.

First class January 24th, last class March 27th, 10 classes, the tuition is $415, please fill the pre-enrollment form (not binding), we will then send an invoice as soon as the class is confirmed, pay the invoice to confirm enrollment.
