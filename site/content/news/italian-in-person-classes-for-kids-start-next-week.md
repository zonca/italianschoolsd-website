New students are still being accepted into the program. Please refer to [Elementary classes](/classes) for elementary students and [Middle and High School classes](/accredited-classes) for middle and high school students.

We have classes on Wednesday for Italian as a foreign language at 4pm and Thursday for Italian for Italian speakers at 4:15pm. Both programs are for TK to 12th grade.

Current parents should have received an email with the subject "Benvenuti to Italian School of San Diego â€“ First Class Information". If you have not received it, please [contact us](/contact).
