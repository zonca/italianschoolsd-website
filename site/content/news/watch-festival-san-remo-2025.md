description: How to watch the Italian song contest Festival di Sanremo for free
---

In Italy, when you say "Il Festival", it only means "Festival di Sanremo", the most popular song contest in Italy. The winner of the Festival is going to represent Italy to Eurovision.

It is a great opportunity to expose the kids to the Italian language and culture: whether you like it or not, Sanremo is iconic!

The show streams on RAI 1 from today February 11th to February 15th from 12pm to 4:30pm Pacific Standard Time at:

* [RAI 1 realtime streaming](https://www.raiplay.it/dirette/rai1)

Moreover, RAI posts additional content, like recordings of previous nights, at:

* [Page about the Festival of Sanremo on Raiplay](https://www.rai.it/programmi/sanremo/)
* [Page for the first night of the Festival](https://www.raiplay.it/video/2025/02/Sanremo-2025-75-Festival-della-Canzone-Italiana-Prima-serata-del-11022025-d6cc68b8-c90a-4e0b-8bf9-88ce0de3ce69.html)

Just for Sanremo the Italian television removes geographical restrictions, so you **do not need** a VPN.

You can watch it on a TV or smartphone by installing the "Raiplay" app, opening a browser and going to `raiplay.it` (for example Amazon Silk on Firestick or "Internet" on Samsung TVs), or by streaming it on your laptop and casting the tab to the TV.
If you own a Chromecast, the easiest option is to install the Raiplay app on your phone and then "cast" it to the Chromecast to watch it on a TV.

Buon ascolto!
