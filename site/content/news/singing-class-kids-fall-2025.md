Unlock your child's potential and foster a lifelong love for music with our engaging singing classes! At the Italian School of San Diego, we believe that singing is more than just hitting notes; it's a powerful tool for self-expression, confidence building, and cognitive development. Our fun and supportive environment allows children to explore their voices, develop essential musical skills, and discover the joy of performing.

We are thrilled to expand our children's program to include dedicated singing classes for the 2025-2026 academic year. Designed for kids from 2nd to 6th grade, our classes are split by age to ensure personalized attention and guidance for every young singer. No prior experience in music theory or singing is required – just a passion for music and a willingness to learn!
