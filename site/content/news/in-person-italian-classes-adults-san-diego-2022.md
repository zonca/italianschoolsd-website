Buongiorno, we have decided to start 2 classes for adults on Thursdays after the classes for kids, from 6:15pm to 7:45pm, at Language Door in Kearny mesa.

We will have a beginner class that assumes no previous knowledge of Italian and a low-intermediate level for people which had a least 1 year of Italian classes or equivalent self-study.

See <https://www.italianschoolsd.com/enroll-adults/> to check available classes and to enroll.

If you do not see any suitable class, [please fill in the adult interest form](https://forms.gle/LHR7Htpeb3mQzV838) and we will email you when we get to quorum for starting a new class.
