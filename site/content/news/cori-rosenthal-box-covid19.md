Since COVID is airborne and the Omicron variant extremely contagious, indoor
air quality has never been more important.
At the Italian school of San Diego, all classroom have very good ventilation thanks
to having a door facing outside and a door facing the auditorium. Except one
that has both doors facing the auditorium, so we felt the necessity to supplement
ventilation in that room using a Cori-Rosenthal box.

In this post I'll share some images on how to build a Cori-Rosenthal filtration box,
here is the final product:

* [Gaffer tape (seals better than duct tape), white, $19 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMNYFHI/)

## Building process

There are several online videos, I [followed this one on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEn2xzlvrdo), and the [blog post by Jim Rosenthal](https://www.texairfilters.com/a-variation-on-the-box-fan-with-merv-13-filter-air-cleaner/).

A few photos of the process, I also cut a small slit in the back of the fan to simplify contact with the filter.

## Fan shroud
Finally I added a fan shroud to improve efficiency, as [suggested by David Elfstrom](https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom/status/1424069532117880841), the internal diameter of the shroud should be 13.5 inches with a Hurricane fan.
