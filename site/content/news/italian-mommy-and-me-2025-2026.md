We are happy to introduce our Italian "Mommy and Me" style morning program for the 2025-2026 academic year! We use the phrase **"Mommy and Me" only because it is the most commonly recognized name for this type of class — ALL caregivers are warmly welcome** (dads, grandparents, relatives, nannies, etc.).

This playful, language-rich experience is for toddlers **18 months to 3 years old** together with their caregiver. No prior Italian is required.
