## New location

Unfortunately Our Mother of Confidence notified us last May that due to changing rules at the Diocese, they wouldn’t have been able to host us for 2022-2023.

We have found a new location in Kearny Mesa, just out the 805, at 7380 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. We sublease the entire language school “Language Door” on Thursdays 4-6pm.

## Pre-enrollment for 2022-2023 is open

Please submit pre-enrollment by August 26th, we will then send you the confirmed class and teacher by August 29th and you’ll have until September 5th to pay the invoice and finalize enrollment.

First class on Thursday September 8th 4pm-6pm.
