title: Italian classes for travelers to Italy in April and May 2024
date: 2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z

Over the course of 2019 6 million Americans travelled to Italy, that is a tenth of the entire population of Italy itself!

I'm sure you would like to go prepared, at least with basic survival phrases that can help you go outside of the beaten path where Italians could not speak English, and some extra confidence in using Google Translate or a "Italian phrases for travelers" book!

We will be covering basic phrases at the airport, hotel, restaurant, emergency room, pharmacy, beach and all details about coffee and pizza that only Italians know. No previous knowledge of Italian necessary, however you are very welcome if you already know some Italian and want to strenghten your travel-related vocabulary.

We are excited to offer a 4-week "Italian for travelers" program, with a session focused on the entire family, so you can bring your kids (8 years old and above) with you and a session for adults only:

* "Italian for family travel" for adults and kids over 8 years old, Wednesdays **4pm-5:30pm**, please [contact us](/contact) if you would like to bring younger siblings, we can organize entertainment for them in our kids room during class
* "Italian for travelers" for adults (16 years old and over ), Wednesdays **5:45pm-7:15pm**

Both programs run in April and May:

* April session, April 10th - May 1st
* May session, May 8th - May 29th

The price for one 4-week program is $120 for the first adult signing up, $80 for additional adults in the same family and $50 for kids.
As you add more adults to your cart in our shop (powered by [Square](https://squareup.com)), the additional adults discount will show up.
