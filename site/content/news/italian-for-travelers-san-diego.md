Over the course of 2019 6 million Americans travelled to Italy, that is a tenth of the entire population of Italy itself!

I'm sure you would like to go prepared, at least with basic phrases that can help you go outside of the beaten path where Italians rarely speak English, and some extra confidence in using Google Translate or an "Italian phrases for travelers" book!

We will be covering basic phrases at the airport, hotel, restaurant, retail store, emergency room, pharmacy, beach and all details about coffee and pizza that only Italians know. No previous knowledge of Italian necessary, however you are very welcome if you already know some Italian and want to strenghten your travel-related vocabulary.

We are excited to offer a 4-week "Italian for travelers" program, with a session focused on the entire family, so you can bring your kids (8 years old and above) with you and a session for adults only:

* "Italian for family travel" for adults and kids over 8 years old, Fridays **4pm-5:30pm**, please [contact us](/contact) if you would like to bring younger siblings, we can organize entertainment for them in our kids room during class
* "Italian for travelers" for adults (16 years old and over ), Fridays **5:45pm-7:15pm**

The programs run from **May 3rd** to **May 31**, no class on May 24th due to Memorial day weekend.

The price for one 4-week program is $120 for the first adult signing up, $80 for additional adults in the same family and $50 for kids.
As you add more adults to your cart in our shop, the additional adults discount will apply in all 4 programs (even if it only shows up in one of them).
