Pre-enrollments are open for our Italian Summer Camp, starting on June 19th,
no need to have previous knowledge of Italian, however, please pre-enroll also kids that already speak Italian, if we have enough interest we will organize a dedicated class for them.

See <https://www.italianschoolsd.com/summer-camp/> for more details and to pre-enroll.

Pre-enrollment is not binding, once we will have organized the classes and sent out the invoices, paying them will finalize enrollment.
