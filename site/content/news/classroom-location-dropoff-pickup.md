### Dropoff

The parents are allowed to come into the main room and bring the kids to their room door. Make sure you have your mask if you are entering the building.

### Pickup

Smaller kids in K and 1 are staying inside, parents should enter the building with masks and pick them up at the door. Grades 2 to 5, the teacher will bring the kids at the front door and release them to parents.

No food allowed in the main room. After class, if you want to chat please first move up the ramp so we don't have too many people in front of the entrance.
