### What we’ll cover

We work with authentic materials—real Italian content created for native speakers (e.g., news articles, podcasts, interviews, ads, short videos). This builds the skills the AP exam measures: understanding real-world language and responding appropriately.

- Listening: Practice with native audio/video to improve comprehension.
- Reading: Work with current articles and texts to enhance understanding.
- Writing: Assignments to develop essay writing and free-response skills.
- Speaking: Activities to improve conversational Italian and oral presentation abilities.

Join us to ensure you are well-prepared for all aspects of the AP Italian exam!

### Instructor

This preparation is led by our School Director, Maura D’Andrea. Maura holds a Master’s degree in Education from Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan) and a postgraduate specialization in “Didactics and Promotion of Italian Language and Culture to Foreigners” from Università Ca’ Foscari Venezia.

### Schedule (in person)

All meetings focus on authentic materials and AP-style tasks (reading, listening, writing, speaking). Students will also complete full exam simulations and receive individual feedback.

- January 24 & 31 — 3-hour sessions (time TBD with students)
- February 7 & 21 — 3-hour sessions (time TBD with students)
- March 7 & 21 — 3–4-hour sessions (time TBD with students)
