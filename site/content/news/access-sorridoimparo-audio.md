## Access the book in digital form

* Go to <https://www.hubscuola.it>
* Register an account as a student or a parent, specify "Provincia straniera", "USA"
* Verify email
* Click on "Attiva libro"
* Insert the alphanumeric PIN written in red on the back of the front cover of the printed book
* Click on "Vai alla libreria" to open the digital version of the book in your browser
* Or follow the instructions in "Scarica l'App" if you wish to install the reader on a Smartphone or tablet

## Access audio content

At the very beginning of each book, generally in the first page after the Index, at the top, there is a [QR scode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code).

You need to scan the QR code with your smartphone, you have 3 options:

* try first to point your phone's camera to the QR code, if a link pops up, click on it
* if you already have Google Lens installed, open it, point to the QR code and click search and then on the link
* download the [Hub Smart app](https://www.rizzolieducation.it/digitale/hub-smart-2/) on your phone, [for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mondadori.hubsmart) or [for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/hub-smart/id1404230827?mt=8). Click on the Hub Smart logo and point to the QR code

In all 3 cases you should see a list of Audio clips with their relative page number in the book. No need to login or create an account.

Usually 1 QR code covers 2 or 3 chapters, then at the beginning of the following chapter, there will be another QR code, look in the Index at what page chapters start if you can't find them.

At the moment a few clips are still missing, they are probably still in the process of uploading them.
