It is less than 2 miles from Our Mother of Confidence.

Restrooms are located right in front of the parking lot.

## Cosa - What

Marcello Pizza Napoli will bring his mobile wood-fire pizza oven to the park and will prepare delicious Napoli-style pizzas for the group, each family will have to pay a fixed price per person directly to Marcello.

* Appetizer with bruschetta, pasta and salad.
* **Giropizza**: Marcello will prepare and cook different kind of pizzas, that will be served by the slice. The portable woodfire oven can only cook 3 pizzas at a time, so, depending on the number of attendees, there will be some wait time. He will give priority to the kids.
* Pizza with Nutella as dessert
* $20 for each person, $15 for kids aged 6-11, free 5 years old and below.
* Drinks not included
