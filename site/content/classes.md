We are excited to announce that we now offer Spanish classes for kids in grades 2nd-6th. These classes are designed for children who want to learn Spanish as a second language. Instruction will be provided in a fun and interactive way, focusing on vocabulary building, pronunciation, and conversational skills, getting the students ready to successfully transition to Spanish classes in middle school. No previous knowledge of Spanish necessary.

## Italian Heritage classes for kids TK-6

> “*La lingua e' l'ultima proprieta' di chi parte per sempre*”
(Erri de Luca, I pesci non chiudono gli occhi)

Italian Heritage classes allow kids that are already advanced or fluent in Italian, not necessarily mother-tongue, to deepen their knowledge of the
Italian language and learn many of the topics taught to their peers in Italy, starting from the four basic language skills: comprehension, reading , writing and oral production. Beginning in 3rd grade, the program will be enriched with the study of history and geography topics from the Italian public school curriculum. All classes are taught in Italian by a mother-tongue Italian instructor.

Classes will have between 5 and 10 students and held in person.
Our classes are suitable to prepare the students for [accredited classes](/accredited-classes), which generally start in 6th or 7th grade.

In-person classes are 2 hours per week, **4-6pm on Thursdays**, first class on **August 29th**,
last class on May 29th for a total of 33 weeks of instruction (+1 week for backup in case of cancellations).
