## Italian Heritage classes for kids K-6

> “*La lingua e' l'ultima proprieta' di chi parte per sempre*”
(Erri de Luca, I pesci non chiudono gli occhi)

Italian Heritage classes allow kids that are already advanced or fluent in Italian, not necessarily mother-tongue, to deepen their knowledge of the
Italian language and learn many of the topics taught to their peers in Italy, starting from the four basic language skills: comprehension, reading , writing and oral production. Beginning in 3rd grade, the program will be enriched with the study of history and geography topics from the Italian public school curriculum. All classes are taught in Italian by a mother-tongue Italian instructor.

Classes will have between 5 and 10 students and held in person.
Our classes are suitable to prepare the students for [accredited classes](/accredited-classes), which generally start in 6th or 7th grade.

In-person classes are 2 hours per week, **4-6pm on Thursdays**, first class on **August 29th**,
last class on May 29th for a total of 33 weeks of instruction (+1 week for backup in case of cancellations).

See the [Italian school of San Diego calendar](/calendar) for our Google Calendar schedule.

## Italian classes for home-schooled kids

We can organize Italian group classes in the morning for kids which are home-schooled or for preschoolers, either at our location or on-site. These classes use play time and games to introduce kids to a foreign language starting from 3 years old.

Italian school is a vendor for [Pacific Coast Academy](https://pacificcoastacademy.org/), therefore you can use charter funds to pay for our classes. If your kid is enrolled in another Charter, please contact us, we can apply to be vendors.
