## Italian Heritage classes for kids TK-6

> “*La lingua e' l'ultima proprieta' di chi parte per sempre*”
(Erri de Luca, I pesci non chiudono gli occhi)

Italian Heritage classes allow kids that are already advanced or fluent in Italian, not necessarily mother-tongue, to deepen their knowledge of the
Italian language and learn many of the topics taught to their peers in Italy, starting from the four basic language skills: comprehension, reading , writing and oral production. Beginning in 3rd grade, the program will be enriched with the study of history and geography topics from the Italian public school curriculum. All classes are taught in Italian by a mother-tongue Italian instructor.

Classes will have between 5 and 10 students and held in person.
Our classes are suitable to prepare the students for [accredited classes](/accredited-classes), which generally start in 6th or 7th grade.

In-person classes are 2 hours per week, **4-6pm on Thursdays**, first class on **August 29th**,
last class on May 29th for a total of 33 weeks of instruction (+1 week for backup in case of cancellations).

See the [Italian school of San Diego calendar](/calendar) for our Google Calendar schedule.

## Italian for Spanish speakers (TK-6)

Italian classes for Spanish speakers are designed for kids who already speak Spanish and want to learn Italian. These classes will leverage the similarities between the two languages to facilitate the learning process.

Instruction will be provided in both English and Spanish, allowing students to understand and practice Italian using their existing knowledge of Spanish. The classes will focus on building vocabulary, improving pronunciation, and developing conversational skills.

* **4-6pm on Wednesday**, first class on **September 4th**, last class on May 28th
