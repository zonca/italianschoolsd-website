## Italian Heritage Classes for Kids (TK–6)

> “*La lingua è l'ultima proprietà di chi parte per sempre*”  
(Erri de Luca, I pesci non chiudono gli occhi)

Italian Heritage classes are designed for children who are already advanced or fluent in Italian, though not necessarily native speakers. These classes help deepen their knowledge of the Italian language and cover many topics taught to their peers in Italy, focusing on the four basic language skills: comprehension, reading, writing, and speaking. Starting in 3rd grade, the curriculum includes history and geography topics from the Italian public school program. All classes are taught in Italian by a native Italian instructor.

Classes have 5–10 students and are held in person. Our program prepares students for [accredited classes](/accredited-classes), which typically begin in 6th or 7th grade.

In-person classes meet for 2 hours per week: **Thursdays, 4:15–6:15pm**. The first class is on **August 28th, 2025** and the last class is on **May 21st, 2026**, for a total of 33 weeks of instruction (+1 backup week in case of cancellations).

## Italian as a Foreign Language (IFL) Classes for Kids (TK–6)

Italian as a Foreign Language (IFL) classes are for students who are new to Italian or are beginners. Instruction is in English, starting with the basics of Italian using a conversation-first approach and engaging activities to reinforce language skills.

Classes have 5–10 students.

In-person classes are 2 hours per week:

* Afternoon program: **Wednesdays, 4–6pm**. First class: **August 27th, 2025**. 33 classes + 1 backup in case of cancellation. Last class (backup): **May 20th, 2026**.
* Morning program for home-schoolers: **Wednesdays, 10am–12pm**. First class: **August 27th, 2025**. Last class: **May 20th, 2026**. This program is also available to students of Pacific Coast Academy.

Students are grouped by age.

## Italian for Spanish Speakers (TK–6)

These classes are for children who already speak Spanish and want to learn Italian. The curriculum leverages the similarities between the two languages to make learning easier.

Instruction is provided in both English and Spanish, helping students use their Spanish knowledge to learn Italian. The focus is on building vocabulary, improving pronunciation, and developing conversational skills.

We do not plan to offer this program in 2025–2026. However, if you are interested, please [contact us](/contact) to express your interest. We may be able to arrange private or semi-private classes based on demand.

## Italian Classes for Home-Schooled Kids

We can organize Italian group classes in the morning for home-schooled children or preschoolers, either at our location or on-site. These classes use play and games to introduce children to Italian starting from age 3.

[Contact us](/contact) to schedule a call and discuss options.

The Italian School is a vendor for [Pacific Coast Academy](https://pacificcoastacademy.org/), so you can use charter funds to pay for our classes. If your child is enrolled in another charter, please contact us—we can apply to become vendors.
