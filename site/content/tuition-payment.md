Tuition payment is due in 1 payment on July 15th for early enrollment or August 15th for later enrollement, unless you opt for the monthly plan.

## 8-payments plan

The 8-payments plan is a convenience so that you can pay in multiple installations, you are still committing for the full year, in case you would like to proceed with cancellation, see the cancellation policy below.

More details about the payment plan:

* additional administrative fee of 20%
* 1/8 of tuition is due on August 15th with any payment method to confirm enrollment
* 7 monthly payments October 1st to April 1st (no checks accepted for these monthly payments)
* for example, an in-person heritage class with payment plan costs a total of `$1656*1.2=1987`, it has 8 monthly payments of `$248.40`.
* If the monthly payment invoice is more than 2 weeks late after the invoice is due, a $50 late payment fee will apply, the fee increases to $100 for invoices unpaid for more than 1 month.

## Sibling discount

The first additional family member enrolled has a 10% discount, the second 15% discount and so on (discounts are cumulative).
In case of families with kids both in accredited and in non-accredited classes, the higher discount applies to the lower tuition.

## Payment method

The preferred payment method is [**Zelle** (free and supported by most US banks)](https://www.zellepay.com/get-started), we also accept checks and credit cards. Payments via credit cards incur a 3.6% payment processing fee.
Please make the checks payable to `Italian school of San Diego LLC`, do not forget "LLC".

## Cancellation for the full-payment option
