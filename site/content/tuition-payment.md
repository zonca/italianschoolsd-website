Tuition payment is due in 2 equal payments (on August 27th and January 15th), unless you opt for the monthly plan.

## Monthly plan

Alternatively, we offer a monthly payment plan:

* additional administrative fee of 10%
* 2/9 of tuition is due August 27th with any payment method
* 7 monthly payments October 1st to April 1st (no checks accepted for these monthly payments)
* for example, an in-person heritage class with monthly payments costs a total of `$1489*1.1=1638`, it has 9 monthly payments of $182. Two of those payments (first and last month) are due at enrollment ($364), the other 7 monthly starting on October 1st and ending on April 1st (May was already paid at enrollment)

## Sibling discount

The first additional family member enrolled has a 10% discount, the second 15% discount and so on (discounts are cumulative).
In case of families with kids both in accredited and in non-accredited classes, the higher discount applies to the higher tuition.

## Payment method

The preferred payment method is [**Zelle** (free and supported by most US banks)](https://www.zellepay.com/get-started), we also accept checks and credit cards.
Please make the checks payable to `Italian school of San Diego LLC`, do not forget the LLC.

## Cancellation

Enrollment in the Italian school can be canceled with 30 day notice via email (to `admin` on our website domain `italianschoolsd.com`), tuition will be prorated (at the month-by-month rate in case of prepayment) and partially reimbursed if necessary, a $50 administrative fee will be added to the account. No cancellations are accepted after March 31st.

Tuition will be fully reimbursed if cancellation is 2 weeks before school starts.
