Tuition payment is due in 1 payment on September 1st, unless you opt for the monthly plan.

## 8-payments plan

The 8-payments plan is a convenience so that you can pay in multiple installations, you are still committing for the full year, in case you would like to proceed with cancellation, see the cancellation policy below.

More details about the payment plan:

* additional administrative fee of 20%
* 1/8 of tuition is due on September 1st with any payment method to confirm enrollment
* 7 monthly payments October 1st to April 1st (no checks accepted for these monthly payments)
* for example, an in-person heritage class with payment plan costs a total of `$1656*1.2=1987`, it has 8 monthly payments of `$248.40`.
* If the monthly payment invoice is more than 2 weeks late after the invoice is due, a $50 late payment fee will apply

## Sibling discount

The first additional family member enrolled has a 10% discount, the second 15% discount and so on (discounts are cumulative).
In case of families with kids both in accredited and in non-accredited classes, the higher discount applies to the lower tuition.

## Payment method

The preferred payment method is [**Zelle** (free and supported by most US banks)](https://www.zellepay.com/get-started), we also accept checks and credit cards.
Please make the checks payable to `Italian school of San Diego LLC`, do not forget the LLC.

## Cancellation for the full-payment option

Tuition will be fully reimbursed if cancellation is 2 weeks before school starts.
50% will be refunded if cancellation is received in writing (to `admin` on our website domain `italianschoolsd.com`) before the 3rd class.
No refunds after the 3rd class.

## Cancellation for the monthly plan

Enrollment in the Italian school can be canceled with 30 day notice via email (to `admin` on our website domain `italianschoolsd.com`), tuition will be prorated (at the month-by-month rate in case of prepayment) and partially reimbursed if necessary, a $50 administrative fee will be added to the account. No cancellations are accepted after March 31st.

Tuition will be fully reimbursed if cancellation is 2 weeks before school starts.

## Late enrollments

Enrollments are open all year, pending availability of space in a class. We won't be able to grant High School credits for late enrollments in accredited classes.
Please first [contact us](/contact) so we can check if the age and the italian knowledge level of your kid are suitable for one of our in-person or online classes and that such class has avaiability.

Later we will ask to comple the pre-enrollment form so we can get all the necessary personal information.

Finally we will send an invoice pro-rated based on the number of remaining classes in the year, you can then choose to pay either monthly (with 20% admin fee) or in full.

The due date of the invoice will be after the first 2 classes. If you decide not to finalize enrollment, contact us: we will cancel the invoice and nothing is due. Paying the invoice finalizes enrollment, after that the standard cancellation policy outlined below applies.
