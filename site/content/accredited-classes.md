## Accredited classes

Italian school of San Diego LLC is accredited both with the San Diego Unified and the San Dieguito Union High School Districts as an "Independent World Language School".
Therefore classes taken at the Italian school will give credit for the language requirement for High School graduation for all High Schools within one of the 2 districts, and will also satisfy the admission requirements for colleges. Grades obtained in the Italian classes will be added to the student's transcripts.

For more information, check:

* [the page about world languages of the Office of Language Acquisition of San Diego Unified](https://sandiegounified.org/departments/ola/world_languages)
* [the page about Off Campus World language courses at San Dieguito](https://www.sduhsd.net/Departments/Educational-Services/Specialized-Programs/Off-Campus-Courses/Off-Campus-World-Language-Courses/index.html)

### How many years

High school graduation and college admission require 2 years of a foreign language, but most colleges recommend 3 years, and some Ivy league colleges, like Harvard, recommend 4. See for example the [E) requirement for admission to University of California](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html), quoted here for reference:

> Two years, or equivalent to the 2nd level of high school instruction, of the same language other than English are required. (Three years/3rd level of high school instruction recommended). Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, composition and culture. [..]. Courses taken in the seventh and eighth grades may be used to fulfill part or all of this requirement if the high school accepts them as equivalent to its own courses.

### Offered classes

The Italian school offers 4 one-year classes targeted at students learning Italian as a Foreign Language:

* Italian 1-2, targeted at students starting to learn Italian
* Italian 3-4
* Italian 5-6
* Italian 7-8 and AP preparation, [see the dedicated page about AP Italian](/ap-italian-san-diego)

Moreover, we have modified programs for students, generally of Italian heritage, which already speak Italian fluently:

* Italian 1-2 for Italian speakers
* Italian 3-4 for Italian speakers
* Italian 5-6 for Italian speakers
* Italian 7-8 and AP preparation for Italian speakers, [see the dedicated page about AP Italian](/ap-italian-san-diego)

The curriculum and the programs were created, implemented and district approved by our sister school IAASD, [learn more about their story](/about/legacy-iaasd)

### When is best to start

We recommend for kids to enroll in our Italian 1-2 class in 7th grade, this allows them to take Italian 1-2 and Italian 3-4 in middle school.
Middle schools do not recognize external language classes for credit, however, this allows the kids to start Italian 5-6 in the first year of High School.
Once the kids have successfully passed Italian 5-6 in 9th grade they will be granted 3 years of language, then they could continue with Italian 7-8 in 10th grade to get an additional year of language education for College admission and also prepare for AP Italian.

* 7th grade: Italian 1-2
* 8th grade: Italian 3-4
* 9th grade: Italian 5-6, gets credit with High School for 2 semesters of coursework and 3 years of language education
* 10th grade: Italian 7-8, gets credit with High School for 2 semesters of coursework and 4 years of language education, prepares for taking AP Italian

By 10th grade they have satisfied their language requirement and can focus on elective classes offered in the last 2 years of High School.

Students can also start accredited classes later in their academic career, the latest for reaching 3 years of language would be to start in 10th grade:

* 10th grade: Italian 1-2, 2 semesters of coursework, 1 year of language
* 11th grade: Italian 3-4, 2 semesters of coursework, 2 years of language
* 12th grade: Italian 5-6, 2 semesters of coursework, 3 years of language

Students already fluent in Italian, with knowledge of grammar and familiarity with the Italian culture could also start directly at a level higher than Italian 1-2, after an evaluation.

### Location

All classes will be held via Zoom, with occasional optional social gatherings in person.

### Calendar

* 35 weekly classes, 2 hours each, and 2 hours of independent studies
* Classes start on the week of September 5th and end in mid-June
* The schedule will be decided by each class based on the students' preference, you will receive an email about it after pre-enrollment

## How to enroll

If the student is in Middle School, the student can directly enroll with the Italian school, with no involvement with the school.
If the student in in High School, it is important to notify the school of the intent of the student to pursue language education in an external institution.
Generally it is necessary to fill a form and send it to the counselor.
