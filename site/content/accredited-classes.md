## Accredited Italian Classes for Middle and High School Students

The Italian School of San Diego LLC is accredited by both the San Diego Unified and San Dieguito Union High School Districts as an "Independent World Language School." Classes taken at the Italian School fulfill the language requirement for high school graduation at all public high schools within these two districts and also satisfy college admission requirements. Grades earned in Italian classes will be added to students' high school transcripts.

The curriculum and programs were created, implemented, and district-approved by our sister school, IAASD (now closed). [Learn more about their story](/about/legacy-iaasd).

### Class Levels and Schedule

The Italian School offers four one-year classes for students learning Italian as a foreign language:

* `ifl1-2` Italian 1-2: For beginners, online or in-person. Schedule TBD.
* `ifl3-4` Italian 3-4: In-person, Wednesdays 4:00–6:00 pm. First class: August 27th.
* `ifl5-6` Italian 5-6: Online. Schedule TBD.
* `ifl7-8` Italian 7-8 & AP Preparation: [See the AP Italian page](/ap-italian-san-diego). Online, Mondays 5:00–7:00 pm. First class: August 25th.

We also offer modified programs for students—generally of Italian heritage—who already speak Italian:

* `ita1-2` Italian 1-2 for Italian speakers: In-person, Thursdays 4:00–6:00 pm. First class: August 28th.
* `ita3-4` Italian 3-4 for Italian speakers: In-person, Thursdays 4:00–6:00 pm. First class: August 28th.
* `ita5-6` Italian 5-6 for Italian speakers: In-person, Thursdays 4:00–6:00 pm. First class: August 28th.
* `ita7-8` Italian 7-8 & AP Preparation for Italian speakers: [See the AP Italian page](/ap-italian-san-diego). Online, Mondays 4:30–6:30 pm. First class: August 18th.

Students with prior Italian study may test into a higher level than 1-2. Please indicate this on the pre-enrollment form or contact us in advance. Note: If a student enrolls in, for example, `ifl5-6` during high school, they will receive three years of foreign language credit. Credit is tied to the class level, not the number of years attended.

### Location

All classes are held via Zoom, with occasional in-person social gatherings.

### Calendar

* 35 weekly classes, 2 hours each, plus 2 hours of independent study per week
* Classes start the week of September 4th and end the first week of June
* Most classes have a set schedule (see above). For classes with TBD schedules, timing will be decided based on teacher and student availability—generally the same day each week between 4:30 and 6:30 pm. You will receive an email after pre-enrollment.

### Books

Book information will be provided after students are assigned to classes.

## How to Enroll

* Middle school students can enroll directly with the Italian School—no school involvement required.
* High school students must notify their school of their intent to pursue language education externally. Usually, a form must be completed and sent to the counselor.

See tuition details and submit a non-binding pre-enrollment form using the button below. The same form is used for both accredited and non-accredited classes. Based on the student's level and age, we will recommend the most suitable class:

### Workload and Grading

Accredited classes require at least 2 hours of homework per week (compared to 30 minutes to 1 hour for lower levels). Students should plan accordingly.

Grading is more structured: students will join our Google Classroom, submit weekly homework for grading, and take tests via Google Forms during class (with camera on). Final grades are based on homework, tests, and class participation.

Parents receive grade reports four times a year. For public high school students in San Diego Unified or San Dieguito, January and June reports are also sent to the high school for transcript inclusion.

### How Many Years Are Needed?

High school graduation and college admission require two years of a foreign language, but most colleges recommend three years, and some Ivy League schools (e.g., Harvard) recommend four. See the [E) requirement for admission to the University of California](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/first-year-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html):

> Two years, or equivalent to the 2nd level of high school instruction, of the same language other than English are required. (Three years/3rd level of high school instruction recommended). Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, composition, and culture. [...] Courses taken in the seventh and eighth grades may be used to fulfill part or all of this requirement if the high school accepts them as equivalent to its own courses.

### When Is the Best Time to Start?

We recommend enrolling in Italian 1-2 in 7th grade. This allows students to complete Italian 1-2 and 3-4 in middle school. While high schools do not grant credit for language classes taken in middle school, starting early allows students to satisfy requirements sooner. After passing Italian 5-6 in 9th grade, students are granted three years of language credit. They can then take Italian 7-8 in 10th grade for an additional year of language and AP Italian preparation. By 10th grade, students have satisfied their language requirement and can focus on electives in the last two years of high school.

Typical academic path:

* 7th grade: Italian 1-2
* 8th grade: Italian 3-4
* 9th grade: Italian 5-6 (credit for 2 semesters and 3 years of language)
* 10th grade: Italian 7-8 (credit for 2 semesters and 4 years of language; AP Italian preparation)

Students can also start later. To reach three years of language credit, the latest start is 10th grade:

* 10th grade: Italian 1-2 (1 year)
* 11th grade: Italian 3-4 (2 years)
* 12th grade: Italian 5-6 (3 years)

Or start as early as 6th grade, finishing language requirements in 9th grade:

* 6th grade: Italian 1-2
* 7th grade: Italian 3-4
* 8th grade: Italian 5-6
* 9th grade: Italian 7-8 (credit for 2 semesters and 4 years of language; AP Italian preparation). At least one class must be taken in high school to meet the three-year requirement.

Students already fluent in Italian, with grammar knowledge and cultural familiarity, may start at a higher level after evaluation.
