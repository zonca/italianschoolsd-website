**Is Italian citizenship or a life in Italy your goal?**

The Italian School of San Diego, in collaboration with **Max Manzoni, J.D.**—an Italian-American attorney with law degrees from both the U.S. and Italy—offers a comprehensive range of services for those seeking Italian citizenship or residency. 

Both the **United States and Italy recognize dual citizenship**, allowing you to retain your U.S. citizenship while gaining all the benefits of Italian nationality.

## Why pursue Italian citizenship?

Italian citizenship opens the door to a range of personal and practical advantages. It allows for full mobility within the **European Union**, meaning you can live, work, and study freely in any EU member state. For many, it also represents a powerful cultural reconnection—an opportunity to honor and preserve their Italian heritage. Additionally, citizenship provides access to Italy’s high-quality public healthcare system and educational institutions, enhancing long-term quality of life for individuals and families alike.

While the rewards are significant, the process can be complex. Common challenges include obtaining accurate records, overcoming language barriers, and navigating bureaucratic red tape. Recent changes to Italian citizenship laws have added further complications, making expert guidance more important than ever.
