      Italian School of San Diego teaches Italian and the Italian culture to kids and adults. It was launched in collaboration with the Italian American Academy of San Diego (IAASD) as a continuation of their Italian language program for children here in San Diego.
      Our goal is to promote and enhance the learning of the Italian language and culture from a didactic and human point of view. Each week students are welcomed into an engaging environment that favors the pleasure of learning, and the Italian school gives students and their families a space to congregate, united by their passion for Italy and its language.
