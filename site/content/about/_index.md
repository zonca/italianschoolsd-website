      Italian School of San Diego LLC teaches Italian and the Italian culture to kids and adults. It was launched in collaboration with the Italian American Academy of San Diego (IAASD) as a continuation of their Italian language program for children here in San Diego.
      Our goal is to promote and enhance the learning of the Italian language and culture from a didactic and human point of view. Each week students are welcomed into an engaging environment that favors the pleasure of learning, and the Italian school gives students and their families a space to congregate, united by their passion for Italy and its language.
