      Italian School of San Diego teaches Italian and the italian culture to kids and adults, it was born from the collaboration and as a continuation of the IAASD (Italian American Academy of San Diego) project.
      Our goal is to promote and enhance the learning of the Italian language and culture from a didactic and human point of view. Working in a welcoming and peaceful environment that favors the 'pleasure' of learning while creating a moment of cultural and relational aggregation for children and their families united by a passion for Italy and its language.
