      Italian School of San Diego teaches Italian and the italian culture to kids and adults. It was launched in collaboration with the Italian American Academy of San Diego (IAASD) as a continuation of their Italian language program for children here in San Diego.
      Our goal is to promote and enhance the learning of the Italian language and culture from a didactic and human point of view. Each week students are welcomed into an engaging environment that favors the pleasure of learning, and the Italian school gives students and their families a space to congregate, united by their passion for Italy and its language.

She volunteers hundreds of hours each year at the elementary school attended by her daughters as room representative, PTA member, dance performance facilitator and teacher's support in class for Math, Literature and Art.
With joy and enthusiasm she also organizes informal events for Italian families to facilitate the integration of newcomers and the practice of the Italian language and culture.

She later studied at WPI in Worcester, Massachusetts, where she received a B.S. in biotechnology and a M.S. in biology. After completing her studies, Marilisa worked briefly as a biologist in La Jolla, before her passion brought her to New York City where she studied acting at John Basil Studios and William Esper Studio. She also worked as an event planner at Columbia University.

In 2015 Marilisa returned to San Diego with her husband and their two young children. She was excited to learn about an Italian school for children in San Diego (Italian American Academy of San Diego, IAASD) and immediately enrolled her then-four-year-old son. She watched with pleasure as his Italian language fluency flourished and was thrilled that both he and she could meet other Italian families in San Diego. In 2017, inspired by the mission of the school, Marilisa joined the faculty of IAASD where she taught Italian to the youngest students, ages 4-6. In 2021, when IAASD’s elementary school program ended, Marilisa transitioned to teaching at IAASD’s sister school, Italian school of San Diego, where she continues to teach students in grades K-3.
