## IAASD story

The Italian American Academy is a not-for-profit organization of parents and educators whose ultimate goal is to preserve and promote Italian culture.
It was founded in 2011 by Nicoletta De Checchi Mazis, Rossella Broglia and Maria Maestrini Williamson. They worked together at the Italian Cultural Center of San Diego and in 2010 they completed their graduate studies at the prestigious University of Venice obtaining a Master’s Degree in Italian Language and Promotion of Italian Culture Abroad. At the end of the program they co-wrote and published a thesis titled: “Comprehensive Plan for a Bilingual, Bi-Curricular School in San Diego”.
As educators and mothers of children in the k-5 bracket, they felt the need for a brand-new type of school, one they would like their own children to attend. Soon the idea of a school harmoniously blending a rigorous European curriculum with the innovative American educational approach started blooming in their minds. That’s when they started working on a comprehensive business plan where they applied the work done for their thesis to the San Diego County reality: an area with an extremely diverse population, the 8th most populated on a national scale, where there are full immersion bilingual schools in every language but Italian!

IAASD started by offering two separate tracks: one for heritage students and one for foreign students, and soon became the only point of reference in San Diego for children who wanted to preserve or to learn Italian. At this point, Maria Maestrini Williamson left to pursue other interests.
 
Over the years Nicoletta and Rossella, with the assistance of Marianna Spinelli, a valuable teacher who joined the academy in 2013, expanded their language offerings by adding more and more levels and eventually they were able to cover all grades from Pre-K to high school. 
 
With the help of Carol Gratzke, President of the School, who provided financial and administrative support and guidance, IAASD became fully approved by two school districts, San Diego Unified School District and San Dieguito Union High School District to give language credits to students. Because of this approval many students were able to receive their language graduation credits and successfully pass the SAT Subject Italian and the AP Italian exams. In 2018 IAASD received the prestigious WASC Supplementary Education accreditation and in 2019 became a test center for citizenship exams in partnership with the University of Siena. 
 
Marianna Spinelli has been offered the opportunity to open an Italian Language Program at [Point Loma Nazarene University Department of Literature, Journalism, Writing and Languages](https://www.pointloma.edu/schools-departments-colleges/department-literature-journalism-writing-languages). This great collaboration will provide an indissoluble bond to foster and support the Italian language and culture to higher levels of education.

After ten years of managing and teaching at IAASD, in 2020, Nicoletta and Rossella decided to retire and close the IAASD no-profit organization. At this point, Maura D’Andrea, already a teacher at IAASD, offered to continue and opened her own school based on IAASD programs and curriculum to carry on the academic activity with the common goal of continuing to offer this outstanding service to the City of San Diego.
