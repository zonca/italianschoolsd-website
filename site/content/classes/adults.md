## Italian-learners classes for kids (K-8) and adults

Italian-learners classes are devoted to prospective students which haven't started to learn Italian yet or are beginners.
Instruction will be in English, it will first cover the basics of Italian, using a conversation-first approach and engaging the students through language-reinforcing activities.

Classes will have between 4 and 8 students online, 5-10 in-person.
All in-person classes require both students and instructors to wear masks, independently of vaccination status, see [more details about our COVID-19 protocol](/covid19).

For **kids in grade K to 8** we offer 2-hour in-person classes or 1.5-hour Zoom classes once a week:

* in-person classes at the same location and schedule of the Italian-heritage classes above
* online classes via Zoom on Monday between 4pm and 5:30pm (first class on September 6th)
* online classes via Zoom on Tuesday, still 4-5:30pm (first class on September 7th)

For **older kids and adults**, we offer 1 hour and 30 minutes classes once a week:

* online via Zoom on Tuesday morning from 9am to 10:30am (first class on September 7th)
* online via Zoom on Tuesday from 6:30pm to 8pm (first class on September 7th)
* in-person class at *Our Mother of Confidence* on Thursdays overlapping with the kids between 4:30pm and 6pm.

please specify your preference at pre-enrollment.

Once we receive all pre-enrollments, we will group the students by age, assign a teacher, decide the most suitable time-slot and notify the students, they will then have until August 27th to confirm their enrollment by paying the invoice.

If none of the classes we offer suits your needs, please still submit the pre-enrollment form and specify in the last field named "Custom request" what your are looking for. We will contact you back to discuss solutions.
