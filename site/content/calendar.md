Below are the school Google Calendars. You can add them to your own calendar in a few different ways.

### How to add these calendars to yours

Option 1 – Fast (Google users):  
1. Make sure you are signed into your Google account in the browser.  
2. Scroll to the bottom-right of the embedded calendar below.  
3. Click the `Add to Google Calendar` button.  
4. In the pop‑up, tick the calendars you want (e.g. Heritage Thursday, IFL Wednesday) and confirm.

Option 2 – From the full page view:  
1. Click the “Full page web view” link for the calendar you want (see links below).  
2. In the bottom-right of that page click the `Add to Google Calendar` button.  
3. Select/add as above.

Option 3 – Subscribe via iCal (.ics) URL (works for Google, Apple, Outlook, etc.):  
Use the “Calendar address in iCal format (.ics)” link for the calendar you want and follow the steps for your app:
* Google Calendar (web): Left sidebar > `+` next to “Other calendars” > `From URL` > paste the .ics link > `Add calendar`.
* Apple Calendar (Mac): File > New Calendar Subscription… > paste URL > Subscribe.
* iPhone/iPad: Settings > Calendar > Accounts > Add Account > Other > Add Subscribed Calendar > paste URL > Next > Save.
* Outlook (web): Calendar > `Add calendar` > `Subscribe from web` > paste URL, name it, Save.

You can remove a subscribed calendar at any time from your calendar app’s settings without affecting the original.

## Days when the school is closed

It is the same calendar of San Diego Unified, except we are closed 1 extra week for Winter break in January (Epifania!) and we are closed on Halloween 2024.
