Italian School of San Diego LLC provides Italian to English and English to Italian translations for documents and written materials. All our translators are native (mother-tongue) Italian.

We focus on clear, accurate translations that preserve meaning, tone, and cultural context. Italian includes regional nuances that are often missed by automated tools, especially in legal, academic, and formal documents.

## Areas We Support

- Legal documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates, contracts, citizenship applications, court documents)
- Business communications (reports, presentations, internal documents)
- Personal documents (letters, certificates, family histories)
- Academic papers (research papers, dissertations, transcripts)

## What We Translate

- Legal documents (certificates, citizenship files, contracts)
- Business materials (brochures, manuals, websites)

- Academic documents (papers, transcripts)
- Medical and technical documents

## Certificate of Accurate Translation

The certificate confirms the translation was completed by a qualified professional and is, to the best of our knowledge and professional judgment, complete and faithful to the source text. The certificate attests only to translation accuracy and does not verify the authenticity or content of the original document.
