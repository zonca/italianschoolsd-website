We accept kids aged 2nd to 12th grade, divided by age in different classrooms at our location, we strive to keep a student to tutor ratio between 5:1 for older kids and 3:1 for younger kids.

At the beginning of the year, we will coordinate with the parents to understand the needs of the students and create a plan to help them succeed, the plan will explain in detail how the students should spend their time at the tutoring sessions. Our tutors will send a brief weekly report to the parents with the progress of the students.

Group tutoring is available starting September 3rd, 2024, the schedule is:

* Tuesday 2:30pm-6pm
