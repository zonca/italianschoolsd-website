## Late enrollments

Enrollments are open all year, pending availability of space in a class.
Please first [contact us](/contact) so we can check if the age and the italian knowledge level of your kid are suitable for one of our in-person or online classes and that such class has avaiability.

Later we will ask to comple the pre-enrollment form so we can get all the necessary personal information.

Finally we will send an invoice pro-rated based on the number of remaining classes in the year, you can then choose to pay either monthly (with 10% admin fee) or in 2 payments.

The due date of the invoice will be after the first 2 classes. If you decide not to finalize enrollment, contact us: we will cancel the invoice and nothing is due. Paying the invoice finalizes enrollment, after that the standard cancellation policy outlined below applies.

## Payment

Tuition is due in 2 equal payments (on August 27th and January 15th), the preferred payment method is [**Zelle** (free and supported by most US banks)](https://www.zellepay.com/get-started), we also accept checks and credit cards.

* additional administrative fee of 10%
* 2/9 of tuition is due August 27th with any payment method

* for example, an in-person heritage class with monthly payments costs a total of `$1489*1.1=1638`, it has 9 monthly payments of $182. Two of those payments (first and last month) are due at enrollment ($364), the other 7 monthly starting on October 1st and ending on April 1st (May was already paid at enrollment)
