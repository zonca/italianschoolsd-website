## Material fee

Starting in 2023-2024, we are charging an additional $50 material fee for kids in the 3 lower levels (arcangeli, cherubini and principati, roughly TK to 3rd grade, but class assignment also depends on fluency).
The fee is due to the fact that lower levels do a lot of crafts and we need some help covering expenses for office and craft supplies we purchase during the year.

check [the dedicated page for details on payment methods, cancellation policy, the 8-payments option and sibling discount](/tuition-payment)

The pre-enrollment form is the same for TK-6th grade students and for certified classes.
