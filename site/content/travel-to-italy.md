The Italian School of San Diego has partnered with [Vero Viaggio](https://www.veroviaggio.com/about) to offer Italian Language immersion trips where the Italian language comes first. These “Italian immersion experiences” organized by Vero Viaggio feature Italian group classes with native speaker instructors, small-group semi-private classes (split by fluency) over a meal and more traditional guided tours and experiences like cooking classes or wine tasting, all in Italian. Their destinations are off the beaten path, to allow people to experience a more authentic view of Italy.

Vero Viaggio’s trips are designed for groups of up to 10 adults to maintain a personal, small-group environment. All activities are conducted in Italian by instructors, guides and locals who are accustomed to interacting with language learners. Which means they can slow down and make sure you feel included in the conversation!

All students of the Italian of San Diego will enjoy a 10% discount on all “Italian immersion experiences” by Vero Viaggio.

Vero Viaggio welcomes all levels of Italian learners, even beginners. Italian school will also launch a set of intensive classes starting in March specifically dedicated to people traveling to Italy, to help you make the most of your trip.
