## Summary

**NOTE**: Updated for 2025-2026

We are committed to providing a safe environment for our students and teachers. Our COVID-19 protocol follows the latest guidance from the California Department of Public Health and the policies of the San Diego Unified School District.

Here are the main points:

* **Vaccination**: All Italian school staff are fully vaccinated and boosted.
* **Symptoms**: Please **do not bring** children to class if they have any flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, cough, or sore throat.
* **Masking**:
	* In line with San Diego Unified guidelines, masks are strongly recommended but not required.
	* Teachers have been provided with N95 masks and may wear them at their discretion.
	* Students are encouraged to wear a N95, KN95, or KF94 mask.
	* Eating and drinking will take place during a 15-minute outdoor break.
* **Ventilation**:
	* Air conditioning units are equipped with high-efficiency filters and set to higher speeds.
    * A [Corsi-Rosenthal filtration box](/news/2021/12/build-a-corsi-rosenthal-filtration-box-for-covid-19/) is in use in the central room.
* **Tracing**:
	* If a student is quarantined at their regular school, they should also skip Italian school.
	* We follow the same quarantine and tracing guidelines as the San Diego Unified School District.
