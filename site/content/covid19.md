## Summary

We give high priority to providing a safe environment for the kids and our teachers,
we will follow a strict COVID-19 protocol informed by the California Department of Public Health
and the policy of San Diego Unified School District.

Here our main points:

* **Vaccination**: All Italian school staff is vaccinated
* **Masking**:
	* Mandatory indoor for students and teachers (except medical condition)
	* No eating or drinking indoor
	* 10 min break outside for eating and drinking, 1 class at a time
* **Distancing** ( > 3ft indoor):
	* 8ft tables with just 2 students each
	* No parents allowed indoor  (chairs available outside if parents prefer to stay at OMC)
	* Classrooms oversized for number of students
* **Cleaning**:
	* Disinfection of tables before and after classes
	* Bathroom has touchless soap / touchless paper towel
* **Ventilation**:
	* Room door open
	* Emergency door on opposite side open
	* Ceiling fan
	* Ground fan (2 fans for room with no ceiling fan)
* **Testing**:
	* Please signup for the free COVID-19 tests at San Diego Unified schools
* **Tracing**:
	* Quarantined at school -> skip Italian school
	* No symptoms checklist to bring at the school, we currently plan to take temperature with touchless thermometer at the entrance

## Detailed guidelines

[Source (CDPH)](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/K-12-Guidance-2021-22-School-Year.aspx)

Masks are one of the most effective and simplest safety mitigation layers to prevent in-school transmission of COVID-19 infections and to support full time in-person instruction in K-12 schools. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is transmitted primarily by aerosols (airborne transmission), and less frequently by droplets. Physical distancing is generally used to reduce only droplet transmission, whereas masks are one of the most effective measures for source control of both aerosols and droplets. Therefore, masks best promote both safety and in-person learning by reducing the need for physical distancing. 

### Physical distancing 

Recent evidence indicates that in-person instruction can occur safely without minimum physical distancing requirements when other mitigation strategies (e.g., masking) are implemented.  This is consistent with [CDC K-12 School Guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html).

### Recommendations for staying home when sick and getting tested

* Follow the strategy for [Staying Home when Sick and Getting Tested from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html#anchor_1625661984621)
* Getting tested for COVID-19 when symptoms are [consistent with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) will help with rapid contact tracing and prevent possible spread at schools.
* Advise staff members and students with symptoms of COVID-19 infection not to return for in-person instruction until they have met CDPH criteria to return to school for those with symptoms:
    - At least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications; and
    - Other symptoms have improved; and
    - They have a negative test for SARS-CoV-2, OR a healthcare provider has provided documentation that the symptoms are typical of their underlying chronic condition (e.g., allergies or asthma) OR a healthcare provider has confirmed an alternative named diagnosis (e.g., Streptococcal pharyngitis, Coxsackie virus), OR at least 10 days have passed since symptom onset.

### Hand hygiene recommendations

* Teach and reinforce washing hands, avoiding contact with one's eyes, nose, and mouth, and covering coughs and sneezes among students and staff.
* Promote hand washing throughout the day, especially before and after eating, after using the toilet, and after handling garbage, or removing gloves.

### Cleaning recommendations

In general, cleaning once a day is usually enough to sufficiently remove potential virus that may be on surfaces. Disinfecting (using disinfectants on the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency COVID-19 list](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/about-list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19-0)) removes any remaining germs on surfaces, which further reduces any risk of spreading infection.

### Food recommendations

It is recommended to offer the children a snack before the start of the lesson. Eating in class will not be allowed.

### Visitor recommendations

Visitors and family will need to wear a face mask while in the school during drop off and pick up time.
