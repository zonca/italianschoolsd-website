    heading: Why learn Italian?
    text: "Young children learn new languages quickly, and Italian opens the door to a rich world of art, history, literature, and cuisine. Studying Italian from an early age can lead to school credit through Advanced Placement or college programs. For adults, learning Italian means connecting more deeply with locals while traveling, enjoying Italian films, and reading classic literature in the original language."

      title: "Italian for TK to 6th Graders"
      text: "Our Italian classes for TK–6th grade are designed for both heritage speakers and beginners. Heritage classes (in Italian) deepen language skills and cover topics from Italian schools, including reading, writing, comprehension, and conversation, plus history and geography for older students. Italian as a Foreign Language (IFL) classes (in English) use a conversation-first approach and engaging activities to introduce Italian to new learners. Classes are grouped by age, meet weekly in-person, and are taught by native Italian instructors. Morning and afternoon options are available, including a program for homeschoolers."
