See [more information about accredited classes](/accredited-classes) before pre-enrolling, and be sure to follow the instructions on that page to notify your high school counselor so credits are properly recognized.

Please **pre-enroll by July 31st** to secure a spot. Later enrollments will be considered if space is available. No payment is required at the time of pre-enrollment. We will email you a confirmation with all class details one week after pre-enrollment closes.

To finalize your enrollment, you must pay the invoice attached to the confirmation email by August 20th. Pre-enrollment is not binding until payment is received.

## Tuition for Accredited Classes

Accredited classes follow an extensive curriculum approved by the school districts and require significantly more effort from both teachers and students compared to non-accredited classes. Districts require students to complete 140 hours of language education per year, with 2 hours in class and 2 hours of independent study each week. This means a higher workload for students, as well as for teachers, who must prepare and grade additional homework.

The tuition reflects the increased teacher workload and the reporting requirements for high school credit.

The total yearly tuition for 35 weeks of instruction (2 hours of class and 2 hours of homework per week) is:

**$2,549** (new students)

**$2,422** (10% discount for returning students enrolled in 2024–2025; this is the same tuition as last year)

Legacy students who have been enrolled in Italian School for 4 years receive an additional 10% discount:

**$2,180** (unchanged since academic year **2022–2023**)

## Materials Fee

There is an additional $150 materials fee for all in-person classes. This covers office and craft supplies purchased throughout the year. The fee does not apply to online classes.

## Late Enrollment

Parents who pay the enrollment invoice **after August 7th** or enroll during the school year will pay 5% higher tuition and are not eligible for returning or legacy discounts:

**$2,677**

If the Italian School is late in confirming a specific class, the late enrollment fee will not apply. In this case, invoices will be sent with the early enrollment discount, and parents will have two weeks to pay with the discounts applied.

See [the dedicated page for details on payment methods, cancellation policy, the 8-payment option, and sibling discount](/tuition-payment).

The pre-enrollment form is the same for TK–6th grade students and for accredited classes.
