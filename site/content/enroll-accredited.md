## Tuition for accredited classes

Accredited classes have an extensive program, as approved by the school Districts, and they require significantly more effort than the non-accredited classes both for the teacher and for the students.
The Districts require the students to have 140 hours of language education per year, where 2 are during class and 2 are of independent study each week.
Therefore the workload for the students is signficantly higher and they need to expect that, the same workload also applies to the teacher that needs to prepare more material for homework and grade the submitted homework.

The cost of the accredited class reflects the larger effort from the teacher and also the reporting requirements of grades to the High Schools.

The total yearly tuition for 35 weeks of instruction (2 hours of class and 2 hours of homework per week) is:

**$2180** (unchanged from last year **2022-2023**)
