Tax planning is central to a smooth retirement transition. Proper coordination helps avoid double taxation, penalties, and unpleasant surprises during your first full filing cycle abroad.

## Core considerations

- **When do you become a tax resident?** Spending more than 183 days a year in Italy, or making it your primary home, usually triggers Italian residency. However, as a U.S. citizen, you still have to file in the States. We help you plan your move so you don't accidentally become liable for taxes in Italy before you're ready.
- **Avoiding double taxation:** The U.S. and Italy have an agreement to prevent you from paying tax twice on the same income. We handle the paperwork to make sure you get these benefits.
- **Your Retirement Income:** We clarify exactly how Italy taxes your U.S. Social Security, 401(k), and IRAs, helping you find opportunities to lower what you owe.
- **Reporting your assets:** Both countries want to know about your money abroad. We help you file the right forms (like FBAR for the U.S. and IVAFE for Italy) so you stay compliant without the headache.
- **Timing matters:** When you move money and the exchange rate at that moment can change your tax bill. We help you time your transfers to keep costs down.



## The 7% Flat Tax for Pensioners

This is a special tax incentive designed to welcome retirees to specific scenic small towns in Italy.

- **The Deal:** You pay a flat **7% tax** on *all* your income from outside Italy (like your pension, dividends, and interest). This replaces the usual Italian income tax rates, which can be significantly higher.
- **The Perks:** You are generally exempt from annual wealth taxes on your non-Italian properties and financial investments.
- **How long?** The benefit lasts for **10 years**.
- **Who qualifies?** You generally need to:
  - Receive a pension (public or private).
  - Have lived outside of Italy for the last 5 years.
  - Move to a town with fewer than 20,000 residents in **Southern Italy** (e.g., Sicily, Puglia, Abruzzo, Calabria) or specific areas in Central Italy.

This program offers huge potential savings. We help you check if your preferred town is on the list and ensure you meet every requirement before you pack your bags.

## Strategic sequencing

1. **Look Before You Leap:** We estimate what your taxes will actually look like for your first year so there are no surprises.
2. **Organize Your Accounts:** Sometimes it makes sense to consolidate bank accounts or investments before you move to make filing easier later.
3. **Know Your Deadlines:** U.S. and Italian tax calendars are different. We create a schedule so you never miss a filing date or payment.
4. **Gather Paperwork:** We help you collect the exact documents needed for both countries (like pension statements and bank records) so you aren't scrambling at tax time.
