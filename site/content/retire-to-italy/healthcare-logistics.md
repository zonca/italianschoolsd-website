Moving to a new country involves more than just packing bags. A smooth landing means navigating healthcare, bureaucracy, and daily essentials knowing exactly what to do next. We help you streamline this process so you can start enjoying your Italian life sooner.

## Your Health Coverage

Your health is a top priority. **Before you arrive**, you will need a comprehensive private insurance policy to satisfy your visa requirements.

**Once you are a resident**, you have choices. You can apply to enroll in Italy's National Health Service (SSN)—which offers excellent public care for a low annual fee—or you may choose to keep private coverage for faster access to certain specialists. We explain how the system works, help you evaluate your options, and guide you through the registration paperwork.

## Getting Settled: The Essentials

Setting up your daily life requires dealing with Italian bureaucracy. We help you check off the critical boxes:

- **Becoming a Local:** We guide you through registering residency at your local Town Hall (*Anagrafe*) and getting your tax ID (*Codice Fiscale*), which you'll need for almost every contract.
- **Banking & Bills:** You’ll need a local bank account to pay rent and taxes. We also help coordinate the activation of your electricity, gas, and high-speed internet so everything is running when you walk through the door.
- **Driving & Digital Access:** From understanding whether you can convert your driver’s license to setting up your "SPID" (a digital ID used for government websites), we handle the details that make modern life in Italy function smoothly.

## Logistics & Coordination

Timing is everything. For example, you often need your official residency receipt before you can finalize your healthcare registration or buy a car.

Our team manages this entire timeline for you. Your dedicated coordinator tracks every deadline—from shipping your furniture to signing up for the doctor—and keeps everything visible on your private status webpage, so you never have to guess what comes next.
