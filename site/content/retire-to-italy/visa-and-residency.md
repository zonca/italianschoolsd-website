Moving to Italy starts with the right paperwork. Whether you want to retire completely or keep a foot in the business world, choosing the correct visa is the foundation of your new life. We help you navigate the options, prepare your application, and manage the timing so you can focus on the excitement of the move.

## Choosing Your Path

Most retirees choose the **Elective Residence Visa (ERV)**. This is designed for people who want to live in Italy without working. To qualify, you simply need to show that you have enough steady income (from pensions, investments, or annuities) to support yourself comfortably.

If you have other goals—like investing in an Italian company or connecting with family heritage—we can explore alternative routes like the **Investor Visa** or **Citizenship by Descent**. We help you find the best fit for your personal situation.

## What You Will Need

Applying for a visa can feel like a big hurdle, but we break it down into manageable steps. The consulates generally look for three main things:

1.  **Income:** Proof that you have reliable funds to live on.
2.  **Home:** A signed rental contract or deed showing where you will live.
3.  **Health:** A private health insurance policy to cover you until you are settled.

We help you gather, translate, and organize these documents so your application is clear, complete, and ready for approval.

## Arriving in Italy

Getting the visa in your passport is just the first step. Once you land in Italy, the real transition begins. We guide you through the critical next steps:

- **Permit to Stay:** Applying for your *Permesso di Soggiorno* within 8 days of arrival.
- **Residency:** Officially registering with your local town hall (*Comune*).
- **Tax & Health:** Once you are a resident, you become part of the Italian system. This triggers potential tax obligations and opens the door to the public healthcare system.

## Experience Matters

Your visa choice ripples through everything else—especially your taxes and your housing contracts. A mistake here can be costly later.

Our team ensures all these pieces fit together. Your coordinator aligns your visa timeline with your home search and your tax planning, keeping everything on track. You can see exactly where you stand at any moment on your private project webpage.
