Retiring in Italy typically starts with selecting the correct entry route and mapping your timeline end‑to‑end—from your local Italian Consulate appointment to residency registration in your new Comune.

## Common routes to retire in Italy

- Elective Residence Visa (ERV): For financially self‑sufficient retirees who do not plan to work in Italy. Requires evidence of stable passive income, suitable accommodation in Italy, and private health insurance for the initial period. Work in Italy is not permitted on this visa.
- Investor and other options: Alternative routes may apply if you qualify via investment, citizenship, family connection, or other specific categories. The most suitable path depends on your goals, timeline, and personal profile.

## Typical documents and checkpoints

- Proof of sufficient income (e.g., pensions, annuities, investment income) at levels acceptable to your Consulate.
- Accommodation evidence (rental contract or property ownership) aligning with visa requirements and local registration rules.
- Comprehensive health insurance covering the initial period before you join Italy’s public system.
- Background certificates and other Consulate‑specific forms; translations and legalizations where required.
- Consular appointment scheduling, application submission, and passport return.

## After arrival in Italy

- Residency registration (iscrizione anagrafica) with your Comune once you establish accommodation.
- Tax residency considerations usually triggered by days of presence and other factors—coordinate early with tax planning.
- Health system registration options after residency (see Healthcare & Logistics).

## Why coordination matters

Visa strategy affects tax timing, budget, housing contracts, and travel scheduling. Our integrated team aligns these decisions so each step supports the next. Your dedicated coordinator serves as the single point of contact for this process, ensuring you stay informed via a private status webpage that tracks every aspect of your application and progress.
