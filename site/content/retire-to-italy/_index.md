## At a glance: retiring to Italy

A successful move typically involves five areas. Here’s the short version:

- Visa & residency path: Choose the right route (e.g., Elective Residency, Investor, or other options) and plan the timeline from application to residency registration in Italy.
- Taxes in Italy and the US: Align your US and Italian filings, optimize treaty benefits, and avoid double taxation or penalties.
- Housing & property: Understand buying vs. renting, regional markets, due‑diligence, and closing steps in Italy.
- Healthcare & logistics: Register for healthcare, set up banking, utilities, driver’s license exchanges, and day‑to‑day essentials.
- Travel & settling‑in: Plan efficient house‑hunting trips and relocation itineraries that fit your budget and schedule.

3) Execution with one coordinator: We sequence tasks across law, tax, real estate, and travel. Your dedicated coordinator manages the timeline and provides a private webpage for you to track status, documents, and next steps in real‑time.

4) Ongoing support: Continued guidance post‑arrival for registrations, renewals, and the first full tax cycle.
