Successful retirement relocation is multi‑disciplinary. Our advantage is structured collaboration: shared context, unified planning, and one accountable coordinator.

## **Coordinator** – Italian school of San Diego Staff

**Single Point of Contact & Project Management**

A designated coordinator from the Italian school of San Diego staff serves as your central case manager. This role ensures you have one consistent point of contact to:

- Coordinate the interaction of all team members (legal, tax, property, travel).
- Maintain your master project timeline and documentation.
- Provide you with access to a dedicated, private dashboard where you can track every aspect of your relocation progress in real-time.

## Immigration & Citizenship Law

Italian‑American attorney with law degrees from both the U.S. and Italy. Our external counsel advises on visa selection (e.g., Elective Residence), application preparation, residency registration, and broader risk management for timing and compliance. Prior experience includes Linklaters (Rome & London) and corporate compliance at JPMorgan Chase (New York). Available for in‑person meetings in San Diego or remote consultations.

Luigi is a dual-qualified Certified Public Accountant in both the U.S. (New York) and Italy, bringing over a decade of experience to complex cross-border scenarios. He specializes in assisting high-net-worth individuals and corporate entities navigating the intricacies of international taxation—whether you are a U.S. taxpayer investing abroad or a foreign national conducting business in the States.

His expertise spans strategic tax planning, treaty application, and rigorous compliance, including foreign asset reporting and voluntary disclosure programs. With credentials as an Auditor and CPA in Italy (since 2007) and a New York CPA (since 2018), Luigi offers a truly integrated perspective on fiscal strategies for your move.

## **Claudia Cencelli** – Real Estate Strategy

<img src="/img/claudia_cencelli.jpg" alt="Claudia Cencelli" style="width: 100px; float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

I’m a real estate and relocation Realtor specializing in helping Americans move to Italy and confidently assess home-buying opportunities anywhere in the Country. Born and raised in Roma, Italy, I combine authentic local insight with strong knowledge of the international market, giving clients the clarity they need when making a life-changing decision overseas.

I currently live in Southern California, where I’ve practiced real estate for the past 20 years. That experience means I understand how American buyers think, what they expect from a transaction, and how to translate those expectations into a smooth, informed experience within the Italian market.

My role is to be your trusted liaison between the USA and Italy—bridging language, culture, timelines, and expectations. Whether you’re dreaming of a city apartment, a countryside home, or a coastal retreat, I can support your search anywhere across the entire Italian territory.

If your goal is not just to buy a property in Italy—but to build a life here—I’m here to help you take that step with confidence and peace of mind.

## **Manuela Broccolini** – Travel & Relocation Planning

With over 12 years of experience in high-end travel planning, Manuela specializes in designing personalized itineraries that immerse clients in the authentic culture of Italy. Her expertise goes beyond standard tourism, offering deep connections to the local rhythm of life—from art and cuisine to seasonal traditions and hidden gems.

For retirement planning, Manuela crafts targeted scouting trips that allow you to "try on" different regions, balancing practical property visits with the lifestyle experiences that inspire your move. She handles all logistics with a focus on comfort and seamless execution, ensuring your time is spent exploring, not managing details.

## Coordination in practice

Rather than isolated advisors, this team collaborates on a single roadmap so visa milestones, tax positioning, property decisions, and travel scheduling reinforce each other. The result: fewer contradictions, faster cycle time, and clearer total cost visibility.
