Effective travel planning transforms scouting trips and the early relocation window into structured progress rather than fragmented errands.

## Pre‑move trips

- Property reconnaissance: Focused itineraries grouped by region and price band; limited daily targets to reduce fatigue.
- Administrative prep: Advance appointments (bank, notary, local services) slotted into the travel schedule where possible.
- Seasonal testing: Visiting during non‑peak periods to gauge true local rhythm.

## First 90 days roadmap

1. Accommodation stabilization (finalize rental or purchase transition).
2. Residency, health enrollment trigger, and initial tax planning review.
3. Utility and digital identity completion (SPID, banking apps, payments setup).
4. Community integration: Language refreshers, local networks, and cultural activities.
