Travel is more than just a vacation—it's the first step of your new life. Whether you are exploring potential hometowns or making your final move, we turn every trip into a strategic milestone, ensuring you make real progress without the stress.

## Scouting Your New Home

Before you commit, you need to explore. We design "scouting" itineraries that let you test-drive different regions. Instead of rushing from tourist site to tourist site, we help you see the real Italy.

- **Focused Property Visits:** We group potential homes by region and budget, so you can compare options side-by-side without burning out.
- **Test the Lifestyle:** We encourage visiting during the "off-season" to see what life is really like when the summer crowds are gone.
- **Get Things Done:** If you are ready, we can even slot in preliminary appointments with banks or notaries during your visit.

## The First Three Months

The first 90 days are critical for feeling at home. We give you a clear roadmap to navigate this transition:

1.  **Settle In:** First, we help you finalize your rental or close on your new home.
2.  **Get Official:** We trigger your residency application and health system enrollment immediately.
3.  **Get Connected:** From setting up your internet to getting your digital ID (SPID), we ensure you are plugged in.
4.  **Live the Life:** Finally, we help you find your community, from local markets to cultural activities.

## Speaking the Language

While English is widely spoken in major cities, the charming and tax-advantageous towns we often recommend are deeply authentic. In these smaller communities, even a little bit of Italian goes a long way—helping you connect with neighbors, manage daily errands, and truly feel at home.

We recommend building proficiency *before* you arrive. The Italian school of San Diego offers **[Adult Italian Classes]({{< relref "../adults.md" >}})** specifically to bridge this gap, with options for **group and private lessons**, available both **in-person in San Diego and online**. This ensures you can communicate effectively from day one, regardless of your location or schedule.

## Expert Travel Planning

**Manuela Broccolini**, our travel specialist, doesn't just book hotels. She crafts personalized itineraries that balance your practical goals (viewing properties, signing papers) with the joy of discovering Italy's art, food, and culture. She ensures every trip serves a purpose.

## Why It Matters

Your travel dates impact everything else—from your visa validity to your tax residency start date. Our unified approach ensures each trip advances multiple strategic objectives. Your coordinator keeps all these timelines aligned, so you never book a flight that conflicts with a legal deadline. You can track your entire itinerary and progress on your private dashboard.
