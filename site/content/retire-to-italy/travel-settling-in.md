Effective travel planning transforms scouting trips and the early relocation window into structured progress rather than fragmented errands.

## Pre‑move trips

- Property reconnaissance: Focused itineraries grouped by region and price band; limited daily targets to reduce fatigue.
- Administrative prep: Advance appointments (bank, notary, local services) slotted into the travel schedule where possible.
- Seasonal testing: Visiting during non‑peak periods to gauge true local rhythm.

## First 90 days roadmap

1. Accommodation stabilization (finalize rental or purchase transition).
2. Residency, health enrollment trigger, and initial tax planning review.
3. Utility and digital identity completion (SPID, banking apps, payments setup).
4. Community integration: Language refreshers, local networks, and cultural activities.

## Language essentials

While English is widely spoken in major cities, the charming and tax-advantageous towns we often recommend are deeply authentic. In these smaller communities, even a little bit of Italian goes a long way—helping you connect with neighbors, manage daily errands, and truly feel at home.

We recommend building proficiency *before* you arrive. The Italian school of San Diego offers **[Adult Italian Classes]({{< relref "../adults.md" >}})** specifically to bridge this gap, with options for **group and private lessons**, available both **in-person in San Diego and online**. This ensures you can communicate effectively from day one, regardless of your location or schedule.

## Planning support

Manuela Broccolini designs tailored travel sequences, weaving property, administrative, and lifestyle objectives into one coherent itinerary, and adjusting for budget and pace.

## Integrated coordination

Travel decisions feed housing commitments, visa documentation, and tax timing. Our unified approach ensures each trip advances multiple strategic objectives. Your coordinator acts as the central hub, aligning your travel dates with key milestones and tracking everything on a shared project webpage.
