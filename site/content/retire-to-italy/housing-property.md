Housing choices affect visa applications, residency registration, and tax positioning. Coordinated guidance helps sequence decisions and avoid mismatches.

## Renting vs. buying

- Renting first: Provides flexibility for residency registration and market familiarization; often preferred during the initial months.
- Buying early: May support certain long‑term plans but requires thorough due diligence, cost modeling (taxes, notary fees), and synchronized timing with visa processing.

## Market evaluation

Regional differences in price, transaction speed, and inventory are significant. A structured search considers: local amenities, healthcare proximity, transit links, climate, and seasonal demand patterns.

## Due diligence basics

- Title & encumbrances (visure catastali, visure ipotecarie)
- Structural / compliance checks (urbanistica, energy certifications)
- Contract language clarity (especially preliminary contracts / compromesso)
- Closing cost estimation (notary, taxes, agency fees, potential VAT)

## Sequencing with your move

1. Pre‑visit property shortlist.
2. Targeted travel itinerary (see Travel & Settling‑In).
3. Offer & preliminary agreement (ensure tax and legal review).
4. Final deed (rogito) and post‑closing registrations.

## Integrated support

Real estate strategy influences visa documentation (proof of accommodation), tax planning (ownership taxes), and travel logistics (timing for visits and closing). Our coordinated approach aligns these moving parts.
