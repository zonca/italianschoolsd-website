Buying a home in Italy is exciting—but for many Americans, it can also feel unfamiliar, complex, and hard to evaluate from abroad. Housing choices affect visa applications, residency registration, and tax positioning. Coordinated guidance helps sequence decisions and avoid mismatches.

## Renting vs. buying

- Renting first: Provides flexibility for residency registration and market familiarization; often preferred during the initial months.
- Buying early: May support certain long‑term plans but requires thorough due diligence, cost modeling (taxes, notary fees), and synchronized timing with visa processing.

## Market evaluation

Regional differences in price, transaction speed, and inventory are significant. We work with reputable realtors and local experts throughout Italy to facilitate the right introductions and coordinate property exploration. A structured search considers: local amenities, healthcare proximity, transit links, climate, and seasonal demand patterns.

## Due diligence basics

- Title & encumbrances (visure catastali, visure ipotecarie)
- Structural / compliance checks (urbanistica, energy certifications)
- Contract language clarity (especially preliminary contracts / compromesso)
- Closing cost estimation (notary, taxes, agency fees, potential VAT)

## Sequencing with your move

1. Pre‑visit property shortlist.
2. Targeted travel itinerary (see Travel & Settling‑In).
3. Offer & preliminary agreement (ensure tax and legal review).
4. Final deed (rogito) and post‑closing registrations.

## Integrated support

Real estate strategy influences visa documentation, tax planning, and travel logistics. Our Real Estate Strategy lead acts as a trusted liaison between the USA and Italy—bridging language, culture, timelines, and expectations so the process feels organized and understandable from day one.

We help you analyze potential purchases with a practical, detail-oriented lens—so you can avoid costly surprises and move forward with confidence. The coordinated approach aligns these moving parts, managed by a dedicated coordinator who keeps you updated via a private status webpage.
